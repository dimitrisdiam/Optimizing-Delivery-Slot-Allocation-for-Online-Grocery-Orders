## 🧪 Step 1: Data Simulation

- ✔️ **Created realistic datasets** using Python
- ✔️ **Saved files** in the `data/` directory
- ✔️ Covered all key entities: customers, orders, products, and warehouses

👉 Code for generating these datasets can be found in [`notebooks/data_simulation.ipynb`](notebooks/data_simulation.ipynb)

---

## 📊 Simulated Datasets

- `orders.csv`: Order-level transaction data with timestamps, delivery slots, and values.
- `customer_profiles.csv`: Enriched customer data including loyalty score and preferred time slot.
- `product_orders.csv`: Links orders to products with quantity and unit price.
- `products.csv`: Simple catalog of product names and categories.
- `warehouse_operations.csv`: Operational KPIs at the warehouse level by day.

📝 Full column descriptions are in [`data_description.md`](data_description.md)

## 📊 Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- ✔️ Performed basic insights and distribution analysis
- ✔️ Identified key trends in customer loyalty, product popularity, and warehouse efficiency
- ✔️ Visualized delivery patterns and order volumes over time

👉 Code: [`notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb`](notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb)

### Key Insights Visualized
- Loyalty score distribution and city breakdown
- Order frequency trends and basket value distribution
- Top ordered products
- Average warehouse packing time
