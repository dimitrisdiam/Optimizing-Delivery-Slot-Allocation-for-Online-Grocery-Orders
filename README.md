## 🧪 Step 1: Data Simulation

- ✔️ **Created realistic datasets** using Python
- ✔️ **Saved files** in the `data/` directory
- ✔️ Covered all key entities: customers, orders, products, and warehouses

👉 Code for generating these datasets can be found in [`notebooks/data_simulation.ipynb`](notebooks/data_simulation.ipynb)

---

## 📊 Simulated Datasets

- `orders.csv`: Order-level transaction data with timestamps, delivery slots, and values.
- `customer_profiles.csv`: Enriched customer data including loyalty score and preferred time slot.
- `product_orders.csv`: Links orders to products with quantity and unit price.
- `products.csv`: Simple catalog of product names and categories.
- `warehouse_operations.csv`: Operational KPIs at the warehouse level by day.

📝 Full column descriptions are in [`data_description.md`](data_description.md)

## 🔧 Step 2: Planned Next Steps

- [ ] Perform **exploratory data analysis** (EDA)
- [ ] Create **SQL queries** for business questions
- [ ] Visualize trends (delivery times, customer behavior, etc.)
- [ ] Build a basic **predictive model** (e.g., peak order times or churn)
- [ ] Prepare for **dashboarding** (Power BI / Streamlit / Plotly Dash)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git & GitHub
- [ ] SQL (planned)
- [ ] BI tools (planned)
